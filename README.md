# Transforming-Unstructured-data-using-Excel
In a Data Analysis Project Where the US-President data is decided to be analysed, it is found that the Presidents data is in Unstructured format and needs some data cleansing. So using Excel i have cleaned data set and shaped it to Structured format.
Steps I followed:
1. Trimmed white spaces
2. Formatted cases of words
3. removed duplicate values
4. Highlighted the headers
5. Auto fitted column width and row height
6. Adjusted date format
7. Removed unnecassary columns.
8. Few spelling corrections.

 Now the data set is ready for analysis.
 Thank you.
